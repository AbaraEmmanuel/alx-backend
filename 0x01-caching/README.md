What is a Caching System?
A caching system stores frequently used data so it can be quickly accessed later. Imagine a library where popular books are kept on a special shelf near the entrance for easy access. This way, you don’t have to search through the whole library each time you need one.

What is FIFO?
FIFO (First In, First Out) is a method where the first data stored is the first data removed. Think of a line of people waiting for a bus. The first person in line is the first to get on the bus.

What is LIFO?
LIFO (Last In, First Out) is a method where the last data stored is the first data removed. Imagine a stack of plates. You always take the top plate off first.

What is LRU?
LRU (Least Recently Used) is a method where the data that hasn’t been used for the longest time is removed first. Think of a fridge where you throw away the food you haven’t eaten in a while.

What is MRU?
MRU (Most Recently Used) is a method where the data that was most recently used is removed first. Imagine a toy box where the toy you just played with goes to the bottom, making room for new toys on top.

What is LFU?
LFU (Least Frequently Used) is a method where the data that is used the least often is removed first. It’s like removing the books from the special shelf in the library that no one reads often.

Purpose of a Caching System
The purpose of a caching system is to make data access faster and more efficient. It helps reduce the time needed to retrieve data by storing the most frequently accessed or important data close at hand.

Limits of a Caching System
A caching system has limits, such as:

Size: Limited storage space. Only so much data can be stored in the cache.
Cost: More memory for cache means higher cost.
Staleness: Cached data might become outdated if the original data changes.
Complexity: Managing and updating cache can be complex.
Example: Your web browser uses a cache to store images and files from websites you visit frequently, so the next time you visit, the site loads faster. However, if the site updates, you might not see the latest version until the cache is refreshed.
